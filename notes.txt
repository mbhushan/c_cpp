valgrind: diagnose memory-related problems

the gcc option -Dname=value sets a preprocessor define that can be used

•    Big endian: the most significant bits (MSBs) occupy the lower address. This representation is used in the powerpc
processor. Networks generally use big-endian order, and thus it is called network order.
•    Little endian : the least signficant bits (LSBs) occupy the lower address. This representation is used on all x86
compatible processors.
